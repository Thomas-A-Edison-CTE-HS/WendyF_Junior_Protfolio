  <p>âœ¿Hello, My name is wendy and welcome to a collection of my past work this past year. I am a sophomore at Thomas A Edison CTE High School. I am currently taking Computer Science Principles and I am taking this class to further my knowledge of computer science. Over this course I have learned a lot about coding and how to create websites. I have also learned a lot about the different types of coding such as HTML,CSS, and Javascript. I was able to create these labs and projects using the coding languages I learned in this class. I hope you enjoy them! </p>
